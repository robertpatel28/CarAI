# CarAI â€“ Intelligent Vehicle Insights & Recommendations

CarAI is a full-stack application that helps users get detailed information about their vehicles, personalized upgrade recommendations, maintenance schedules, and local market data. The project follows the **MVC (Modelâ€“Viewâ€“Controller) design pattern** to keep the codebase modular, scalable, and easy to maintain.

## ðŸ§© MVC Structure

- **Models**: Define data entities such as `Vehicle`, `SpecSheet`, `RecommendationPlan`, `MaintenanceSchedule`, and `Listing`.  
- **Views**: Frontend/UI layer to display vehicle data, upgrades, schedules, and listings to the user.  
- **Controllers**: Handle business logic, route requests, and connect models with views (e.g., fetching car specs, calculating service dates, sourcing listings).
